<h1>Landing Page Demo</h1>
<br>
<p>This is a responsive webpage made as an assignment for <a href='https://www.theodinproject.com'>The Odin Project</a> CSS curriculum.</p>
<p>For this page, I only used plain HTML and CSS, and the main objective of the assignment was to get better using flexbox layouts.</p>
<p>Mobile optimization is yet to be done, since it was not part of the assignment.</p>

<h2><i><a href=''>View the page deployed</a></i></h2>
